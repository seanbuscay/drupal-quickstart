=========== WTF? =========== 

This folder includes installation scripts for some useful tools for Drupal
development in quickstart.

 * Aegir     - Hosting management platform
 * Hudson    - Continious integration server
 * memcached - Memory object caching system
 * Oracle    - Insanity in a DB server.  Legacy apps.
 * Solr      - Search server

=========== Tips =========== 

Look in the top of each file for info on 
Notes and tips on using the tools in quickstart are included at the tops of 
the scripts.

=========== How to contribute =========== 

If you have something to decrease the learning curve of these tools, I'd be
happy to include it:

 * Patches to the install-*.sh files
 * URL's (preferably on Drupal.org) that link to information and tutorials
 * .make files
 * Installation profiles.

=========== Support =========== 

I don't offer any help with these tools.

Your best place for support is:
 
 * Listed at the bottom of the help in each of the scripts.  
 * Each project's home page and ask a question there.

Good luck!
